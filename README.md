# Handframe bot

A simple bot that receives a symbol and returns it, surrounded by several (random number; up to 5) layers of hands pointing at it. The color changes from light to dark or vice versa (also randomly):

```text

👉🏼👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👈🏼
👉🏼👉🏻❤️👈🏻👈🏼
👉🏼👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👈🏼
👆🏼👆🏼👆🏼👆🏼👆🏼
```

## Commands to make it compile and run

```sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev```
